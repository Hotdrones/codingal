            <P>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
In grammar, an article is any member of a class of dedicated words that are used with noun phrases to mark the identifiability of the referents of the noun phrases. The category of articles constitutes a part of speech.

Articles combine with nouns to form noun phrases, and typically specify the grammatical definiteness of the noun phrase. In English, the and a (rendered as an when followed by a vowel sound) are the definite and indefinite articles respectively. Articles in many other languages also carry additional grammatical information such as gender, number, and case. Articles are part of a broader category called determiners, which also include demonstratives, possessive determiners, and quantifiers. In linguistic interlinear glossing, articles are abbreviated as ART.

Types of article
Definite article
"Definite article" redirects here. For the comedy album, see Definite Article.
A definite article is an article that marks a definite noun phrase. Definite articles, such as the English the, are used to refer to a particular member of a group. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned, or it may be otherwise something uniquely specified.

For example, Sentence 1 uses the definite article and thus, expresses a request for a particular book. In contrast, Sentence 2 uses an indefinite article and thus, conveys that the speaker would be satisfied with any book.

Give me the book.
Give me a book.
The definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:

The cabbage white butterfly lays its eggs on members of the Brassica genus.
However, recent develop
           </article>


           <aside> Articles are found in many Indo-European 
            languages, Semitic languages, Polynesian languages, and even language 
            isolates such as Basque; however, they are formally absent from many 
            of the world's major languages including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, 
            Mongolian, Tibetan, many Turkic languages (including Tatar, Bashkir, 
            Tuvan and Chuvash), many Uralic languages (incl. Finnic[a] and Saami l
            anguages), Hindi-Urdu, Punjabi, the Dravidian languages (incl. Tamil, 
            Telugu, and Kannada), the Baltic languages, the majority of Slavic 
            languages, the Bantu languages (incl. Swahili). In some languages 
            that do have articles, such as some 
            North Caucasian languages, the use of articles is optional; however, 
            in others like English and German it is mandatory in all cases.</aside>
