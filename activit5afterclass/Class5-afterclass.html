            <h3>Leon scott kennedy</h3>
            <P>Leon Scott Kennedy, more commonly known as Leon S. Kennedy, is an Italian-American[8] currently
               employed as a federal agent by the Division of Security Operations (D.S.O.), a counterterrorism
                agency under direct presidential command. Kennedy is a known survivor of the 1998 Raccoon City
                 Destruction Incident, when he was a police officer. Following his escape, he was forcefully
                  recruited into a top-secret anti-Umbrella team under USSTRATCOM devoted to anti-B.O.W.
                  combat, serving in repeated operations around the world until 2011.

            <P>ennedy drove south into the city as usual but was soon surrounded by zombies while investigating
               a body in the unusually quiet main road. Retreating into an alleyway, he met Claire Redfield,
                another newcomer who was fleeing zombies from inside a diner. They commandeered an RPD cruiser
                 and drove to the Raccoon Police Station to seek shelter and answers.[13] Unbeknownst to them,
                  the car had a stowaway zombie that spontaneously attacked while they were driving, causing a
                   crash into a nearby sign and ejecting the attacker. The car was then destroyed when a gasoline tanker
               collided with it, and the two were separated, traveling independently to the police station.[13]

            <P>ollowing their escape from Raccoon City on the morning of September 30, Claire and 
              Kennedy split up; Claire continued her search for Chris, while a wounded Kennedy cared
               for a weakened Sherry. After seeking protection from the U.S. military stationed outside
                the city, Kennedy and Sherry were apprehended.[15] Sherry was taken into protective
                 custody as a research subject, while Kennedy was interrogated by Adam Benford, a high-ranking
                 government official and military intelligence officer.[16][17][18]</P>

               <p>nnedy was considered to know too much about the incident. However, his survival
                  demonstrated anti-B.O.W. skills highly sought after by the military, especially given 
                  the failure of their special forces to secure the G-virus.[19] He was given an ultimatum:
                    in exchange for Sherry’s safety and his own life, he was recruited into a classified 
                    anti-Umbrella military agency rapidly formed after the incident to destroy Umbrella and prevent
                    similar disasters, reporting directly to the President. </P>
